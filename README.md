## Aimed to create a all-in-one install-script for spreads for Ubuntu and Debian based OSes.
## Where it works
Much of the program will be compiled on the client-side, so it should be cross-platform (yet it was only tested in linaro 14.04 and Mint 17).
## How it works:
#Just install git on the platform of your choice:
```ubuntu terminal```
sudo apt-get install git
```ubuntu terminal```
#Clone this repo by typing 
```ubuntu terminal```
git clone https://github.com/boredland/spreads-deploy
```ubuntu terminal```
#Enter the directory and run the script
```ubuntu terminal```
cd spreads-deploy
aio_install.sh
# Whenever the program asks for superuser-permissions this should be okay.
